# ILP Data Preparation Experiment (Rust)

**A Deep Dive into Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP), Memory Walls, and Mechanical Sympathy.**

This project demonstrates how "prepping" data for the CPU—a — can break the 10 GB/s barrier on a single core by optimizing for the physical reality of the silicon.

## Final Results (40,000,000 elements)

| Method | Execution Time | Throughput | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native (`.sum()`)** | 47.36 ms | ~3.37 GB/s | Sequential Dependency (1 ALU) |
| **ILP Prepped (Manual)** | 12.55 ms | **~12.74 GB/s** | 4 Independent Accumulators |
| **ILP Prepped (Idiomatic)**| 12.90 ms | **~12.40 GB/s** | `chunks_exact` + Array Fold |

## Core Insights & Conclusions

### 1. The "Memory Wall" is a Software Problem
The experiment shows that "stock" performance (3.3 GB/s) is often limited not by the RAM itself, but by the CPU's inability to request data fast enough due to **Data Dependencies**. By prepping 4 independent streams, we saturated the memory bus, reaching **~99% of peak single-core bandwidth**.

### 2. Data Preparation vs. "Smart" Hardware
While modern CPUs are Superscalar and Out-of-Order (OoO), they have a limited "look-ahead" window. 
- **Native:** Creates a bottleneck where each addition waits 4 cycles for the previous one.
- **Prepped:** We manually broke the dependency chain. By providing 4 independent accumulators, we "fed" the CPU exactly what it needed to fill its execution ports, effectively performing **Manual Software Pipelining**.

### 3. The Energy Efficiency Paradox
Faster code is "greener" code. 
- **Race to Sleep:** By finishing the task 3.7x faster, the CPU can return to low-power C-states sooner.
- **Efficiency:** The Prepped method utilizes 100% of the ALU capacity during its run, whereas the Native method wastes ~75% of the energy just keeping the core active while waiting for the next cycle.

### 4. Register Saturation & Bus Alignment
- **Bus Alignment:** Data arrives in **64-byte Cache Lines** (16 floats). Our 4-accumulator prep allows the CPU to process a full cache line every few cycles.
- **Register Pressure:** We used 4 registers to perfectly hide the **4-cycle latency** of the `vaddss` instruction. Adding more (e.g., 8 or 16) would not increase speed as we have already hit the DRAM throughput limit.

## Why "Data Preparation"?

We call this **Data Preparation** because we surgically restructured how data enters the CPU:
1. **Splitting the Stream:** From 1 serial chain to 4 parallel ones.
2. **Geometric Alignment:** Using `chunks_exact(4)` to match the internal register width and bus delivery size.

> **Tech Note:** Even though the code looks sequential, it is executed in parallel. By removing dependencies, we allowed the hardware scheduler to execute all 4 additions simultaneously.
